# Advent of Code

**What is Advent of Code?** From the first puzzle of every year,

> Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on
> each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
> complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

Advent of Code is a great way to learn new programming languages while solving
fun, challenging problems.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is twofold:

1. To share my solutions with others for educational purposes.
1. To track my progress as a developer and improve my skills over time.

I hope that by sharing my code, others can learn from it, and I can also look
back at how I've improved each year.

## Puzzle solutions

> [!NOTE]
> In compliance with [Advent of Code's guidelines], I will not include puzzle
> text or inputs in the repository. If interested, you can find the puzzles
> and input data on the [Advent of Code] website.

Each puzzle solution is stored in a directory corresponding to the day,
and will include specific instructions on how to run the code.

| Year | Language    | Completed up to |

| 2023 | Rust        | Day 2 (2/2)     |

## Good luck and happy coding!
