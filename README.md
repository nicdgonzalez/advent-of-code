# Advent of Code 2023

I have decided to participate in this year's Advent of Code challenge,
and I will be using Rust to tackle the puzzles.

## What is Advent of Code?

It is outlined in the
[second paragraph of the first puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1),

> You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations,
> you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.
>
> Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available
> on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked
> when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

For additional information, click [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

> [!NOTE]
> In compliance with Advent of Code's guidelines, I will not include any
> puzzle text or inputs in the repository.<br>
> If you're interested, you can find the prompts and puzzles on the
> [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Executing Solutions

Lets use Day 1 as an example. To execute the solution:

1. Obtain a copy of the input data. All inputs are unique, so you'll need
to log into Advent of Code to get yourself a copy.
1. After logging in, click [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1/input).
1. Paste that data into `./input/01.txt`, then run the following command:

    ```bash
    # single-digit days should be padded with an extra zero.
    cargo run --bin 01
    ```

1. Voil√†! If all went well, there are now two values in the console.

### Happy coding!
